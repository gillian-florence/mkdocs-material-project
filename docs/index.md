I’m a technical writer with a background in product and systems documentation, focused on making complex information clear, structured, and usable. I create user guides, admin and configuration documentation, knowledge base content, and release notes for SaaS platforms and Salesforce-based solutions.

My work supports both implementation and day-to-day use, with an emphasis on how people actually find, understand, and apply documentation in real workflows. The samples on this site show how I design documentation for administrators, end users, and internal teams.

For a deeper look at my background, experience, and working style, see the [About](about-me.md) page.

## About This Site

This site is built as a practical demonstration of how I work in a docs-as-code environment. It reflects an end-to-end documentation workflow that is structured, versioned, and designed to evolve alongside the product.

The content on this site showcases real documentation artifacts rather than isolated writing samples, with an emphasis on information architecture, task-based content, and maintainability over time.

This site is built using:

- [**Material for MkDocs**](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){: target="_blank" } for static site generation and navigation
- **Visual Studio Code** for local development
- **Markdown** for content authoring
- **YAML** for site configuration and information architecture
- **Git** and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/gillian-florence/mkdocs-material-project){: target="_blank" } for version control and publishing (**GitHub Pages**). 

The result is a living portfolio that demonstrates both the documentation itself and the workflows used to create, maintain, and publish it.
