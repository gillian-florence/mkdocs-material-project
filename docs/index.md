I’m a technical writer based in **Halifax, Nova Scotia (Canada)**, with experience documenting complex SaaS and enterprise systems.

On this site, you’ll find selected writing samples that show how I approach administrator, end-user, and implementation documentation, along with published blog content and background on how I work.

My work focuses on creating clear, structured documentation that supports both system implementation and day-to-day use. I’ve worked closely with product, engineering, and delivery teams on configuration-heavy systems where accuracy, usability, and maintainability matter.

If you’re reviewing this site for hiring or collaboration, the [Writing Samples](writing-samples/index.md) section is the best place to start.

For a deeper look at my background, experience, and working style, see the [About Me](about-me.md) page.

## About This Site

This site is built as a practical demonstration of how I work in a docs-as-code environment. It reflects an end-to-end documentation workflow that is structured, versioned, and designed to evolve alongside the product.

The content on this site showcases real documentation artifacts rather than isolated writing samples, with an emphasis on information architecture, task-based content, and maintainability over time.

This site is built using:

- [**Material for MkDocs**](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){: target="_blank" } for static site generation and navigation
- **Visual Studio Code** for local development
- **Markdown** for content authoring
- **YAML** for site configuration and information architecture
- **Git** and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/gillian-florence/mkdocs-material-project){: target="_blank" } for version control and publishing (**GitHub Pages**). 

The result is a living portfolio that demonstrates both the documentation itself and the workflows used to create, maintain, and publish it.
