# Administrator Guide — Writing Sample

This is a representative writing sample from my work on Salesforce-based solutions. It demonstrates how I design administrator-facing documentation for complex, modular systems, with a focus on clarity, structure, and long-term maintainability.

This sample is presented in multiple formats to reflect different delivery contexts, including a production PDF and a docs-as-code implementation using MkDocs.

**What this sample represents**  
An installation and configuration guide for a modular Salesforce solution, where features can be enabled independently based on client needs. Shared setup is documented once, followed by standalone feature sections to avoid duplication and support scalability.

**Audience**  
Salesforce System Administrators and implementation teams responsible for installing, configuring, and maintaining the solution. The content assumes Salesforce admin experience and focuses on system setup and behaviour rather than end-user training.

**Documentation Structure**  
Common prerequisites and installation steps are documented up front. Each feature is then documented independently using a consistent structure: 

- Overview
- Metadata (objects, fields, flows, permissions)
- Configuration steps

This approach supports selective reading and keeps the guide maintainable as features evolve.

**Salesforce Alignment**  
The documentation follows Salesforce terminology and administrative conventions and references Salesforce Help where appropriate to support accurate implementation.

**Authoring Context**  
The production guide is authored in Microsoft Word and delivered as a PDF. This site presents the same material in a docs-as-code format to demonstrate how the content can be structured, versioned, and maintained using modern documentation workflows.
