# Mass Recurring Non-Availabilities

The Mass Recurring Non-Availabilities feature enhances dispatcher efficiency by streamlining the management of service resource schedules. It enables users to quickly create or delete recurring non-availability records for multiple service resources through a single, intuitive interface.

## Key Features

### Mass Creation of Recurring Non-Availabilities

Dispatchers can create recurring non-availability records for multiple service resources at once. The creation process includes:

- **Filtering** by service territory
- **Defining timeframes** with start and end times
- **Selecting absence types**, such as:
    - Meeting
    - Vacation
    - Training
    - Medical
    - Any custom absence type
- **Setting recurrence patterns**:
    - Daily
    - Weekly
    - Monthly
    - Yearly
- **Choosing a recurrence range**

This eliminates the need to create non-availability entries individually, saving time and reducing scheduling errors.

### Mass Deletion of Resource Absences

Dispatchers can also delete multiple absence records for multiple service resources simultaneously. The utility provides:

- **Filtering options** to retrieve absence records based on:
    - Service territory
    - Absence types
    - Date ranges
- A **visual list** of matching absence records
    - The ability to select or deselect records before deletion, offering granular control over which absences to remove

This feature simplifies ongoing schedule maintenance and improves visibility into team availability.
