## What This Sample Covers

This excerpt focuses on a single feature—Mass Recurring Non-Availabilities—within a larger, highly configurable system.

I selected this feature because it reflects the kind of complexity users actually face: multiple workflows, configuration-driven behaviour, and platform constraints that affect outcomes. Rather than sharing the full guide, this sample demonstrates how I documented one feature clearly and thoroughly.

## Audience

This documentation is written for dispatchers and operational users working in Salesforce Field Service in an office/desktop environment.

It assumes familiarity with Salesforce navigation and terminology and focuses on completing tasks accurately and efficiently, rather than on conceptual or marketing-level explanations.

## What This Sample Demonstrates

- Task-based, procedural writing for complex workflows  
- Clear step sequencing supported by visuals  
- Explicit handling of edge cases and platform limitations  
- Careful use of notes to prevent common errors  
- Alignment with Salesforce UI patterns and terminology
