# User Guide — Writing Sample

This is a representative user guide sample from my work on Salesforce Field Service solutions. It demonstrates how I design task-based, end-user documentation for complex workflows, with a focus on clarity, accuracy, and real-world usability.

This sample is presented as a production PDF to reflect how end-user documentation is delivered in customer environments.

**What this sample represents**  
A focused excerpt from a larger user guide, covering a single feature: **Mass Recurring Non-Availabilities**. 

The feature was selected because it reflects real-world user complexity, including multiple workflows, configuration-driven behavior, and Salesforce platform constraints that affect outcomes.

Rather than presenting the entire guide, this sample shows how I document a single complex feature clearly and thoroughly.

**Audience**  
Dispatchers and operational users working in Salesforce Field Service in a desktop environment. The content assumes familiarity with Salesforce navigation and terminology and focuses on completing tasks accurately and efficiently.

**What this sample demonstrates**  

- Task-based, procedural writing for complex workflows  
- Clear step sequencing supported by visuals  
- Explicit handling of edge cases and platform limitations  
- Intentional use of notes to prevent common errors  
- Alignment with Salesforce UI patterns and terminology
