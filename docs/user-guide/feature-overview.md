# Mass Recurring Non-Availabilities

Mass Recurring Non-Availabilities helps dispatchers manage Service Resource schedules by creating or removing recurring non-availability entries for multiple resources at once. It reduces repetitive manual updates and improves schedule accuracy when planned time off, training, or recurring events affect multiple resources. 

## What You Can Do

Use this utility to:

- **Create recurring non-availabilities for multiple service resources**  
  Select service territories, choose resources, and define the absence time, type, recurrence pattern, and date range.

- **Delete existing non-availabilities in bulk**  
  Filter absences by territory, absence type, and date range, review the results, and delete only the entries you choose.

## Before You Begin

**Prerequisites**

- Access to the Mass Recurring Non-Availabilities utility from the Field Service Console.
- Ability to view and manage Service Resources and Resource Absences.

**Important to note**

- The Service Territories available for selection reflect your Gantt filtering settings.
- If absence approvals are enabled in your org, only approved absences may block availability and display on the Gantt.

    If you don’t see expected Service Resources, confirm you selected the correct Service Territory and that the resource is assigned to it.
