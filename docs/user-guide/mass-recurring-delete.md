# Delete Resource Absences

Use this option to delete multiple Resource Absence records across many service resources at once. This is helpful when an event is cancelled or a recurring schedule changes. 

**Step 1: Select service territories and service resources**

1. Open the Mass Recurring Non-Availabilities utility.
2. Select one or more **Service Territories**, then click **Get Resources**.
   A list of service resources, filtered by service territories, displays. 
3. Select one or more **Service Resources**.
4. Select **Delete Resource Absence**. 

**Step 2: Find absences to delete**

1. In the **Find Absences** section, set your search criteria:

    - **Absence Type:** Select one, many, or all absence types.
    - **Start Date** and **End Date:** Select a date range to retrieve absences for deletion. 

2. Click **Display**.

   The results table lists the resource absence records that match your criteria. 

   **Example:** Selecting **Meeting** absences between **May 1, 2024** and **July 1, 2024**, will return all matching records for the selected resources during that period. 

**Step 3: Delete selected records**

1. Review the results.  
   Use the search/filter controls to further narrow the list if needed. 

2. Select the records you want to delete, then click **Delete**.

   A confirmation message indicates how many records were successfully deleted.
