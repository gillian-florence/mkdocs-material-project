# Athletic Background & Recognition

Before transitioning into tech, I was a member of the Canadian Women’s National Rugby Team for nearly two decades. Competing at the international level while maintaining a full-time career shaped how I approach accountability, teamwork, and sustained performance—values that continue to inform how I work today.

## Athlete Mindset

I spent close to twenty years competing as a high-performance athlete, balancing elite training, competition, and professional responsibilities. That experience required discipline, adaptability, and a strong sense of responsibility to the team—qualities that translate directly to collaborative, high-expectation work environments.

**What that experience reinforced**

- Accountability to teammates and shared outcomes  
- Comfort operating in high-pressure, fast-moving environments  
- A team-first approach to problem-solving  
- Openness to feedback and continuous improvement  
- Focus and resilience during challenging situations  

This background influences how I approach long-term projects, cross-functional collaboration, and accountability in my professional work.
